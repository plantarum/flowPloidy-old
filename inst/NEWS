Changes in version 0.99.2 (2016-10-12)
--------------------------------------

Internal Changes

    * added a new slot to ModelComponents, `paramLimits`, which allows
      lower and upper limits to be set for each model parameter. (corrects
      bug where linearity wanders below 1, giving nonsense results).

Changes in version 0.99.1 (2016-10-11)
--------------------------------------

User Visible Changes

    * Vignette updated to include installation instructions for
      BioConductor

Internal Changes

    * Added accessor functions for ModelComponent and FlowHist classes, so
      direct access of slots via the `@` operator is no longer used outside
      of the initialization functions.

    * replaced some loops with vectorized calculations

    * replaced call to `eval` with a normal function call to `nlsLM` in
      flowAnalyze.R.

    * formatted NEWS file

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2016-08-25)
