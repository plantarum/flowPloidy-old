\usage{
FlowHist(file, channel, bins = 256, window = 20, smooth = 20,
  pick = FALSE, linearity = "variable", debris = "SC", opts = list(),
  analyze = TRUE, gate = logical())

batchFlowHist(files, channel, bins = 256, verbose = TRUE, window = 20,

}
\arguments{
\item{file}{character, the name of the file to load}

\item{channel}{character, the name of the data column to use}

\item{bins}{integer, the number of bins to use to aggregate events into
a histogram}

\item{window}{the width of the moving window used to identify local
maxima for peak detection via \code{\link{caTools::runmax}}}

\item{smooth}{the width of the moving window used to reduce noise in
the histogram via \code{\link{caTools::runmean}}}

\item{pick}{boolean; if TRUE, the user will be prompted to select peaks
to use for starting values. Otherwise (the default), starting values
will be detected automatically.}

\item{linearity}{character, either "variable", the default, or "fixed".
If "fixed", linearity is fixed at 2; if "variable", linearity is fit
as a model parameter.}

\item{debris}{character, either "SC", the default, or "MC", to set the
debris model component to the Single-Cut or Multi-Cut models.}

\item{opts}{list, currently not used, but maybe in future as a way to
test additional model options}

\item{analyze}{boolean, if TRUE the  model will be analyzed
immediately}

\item{gate}{logical, a vector of events to exclude from analysis. In
normal usage this will be set interactively, not as a function
argument.}

\item{files}{character, a vector of file names to load}

\item{verbose}{boolean; if TRUE, \code{\link{histBatch}} will list files
as it processes them.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{FlowHist}} returns a \code{\link{FlowHist}} object.

\code{\link{batchFlowHist}} returns a list of \code{\link{FlowHist}}
  objects.

\description{
Creates a \code{\link{FlowHist}} object from an FCS file, setting up the
histogram data for analysis.
}
\details{
Starting with a \code{\link{flowFrame}} object, read from a FCS file,
\code{\link{FlowHist}} will:

\enumerate{
\item Extract the intensity data from \code{channel}.

\item Remove the top bin, which contains off-scale readings we ignore
in the analysis.

\item aggregates the raw data into the desired number of bins, as
specified with the \code{bins} argument. The default is 256, but you may
also try 128 or 512. Any integer is technically acceptable, but I
wouldn't stray from the default without a good reason.

\item identify model components to include. All \code{\link{FlowHist}}
objects will have the single-cut debris model and the G1 peak for sample
A, and the broadened rectangle for the S-phase of sample A. Depending on
the data, additional components for the G2 peak and sample B (G1, G2,
s-phase) may also be added.

\item Build the NLS model. All the components are combined into a single
model.

\item Identify starting values for Gaussian (G1 and G2 peaks) model
components. For reasonably clean data, the built-in peak detection is
fine. You can evaluate this by plotting the \code{\link{FlowHist}}
object with the argument \code{init = TRUE}. If it doesn't look good,
you can play with the \code{window} and \code{smooth} arguments (which
is tedious!), or pick the peaks visually yourself with \code{pick =
TRUE}. }

\item{\code{bins}}{integer, the number of bins to use to aggregate events into a
histogram}

\item{\code{gate}}{logical, a vector indicating events to exclude from the
analysis. In normal use, the gate will be modified via interactive
functions, not set directly by users.}

\item{\code{histdata}}{data.frame, the columns are the histogram bin number
(xx), florescence intensity (intensity), and the raw single-cut debris
model values (SCVals, used in model fitting). Additional columns may
be added if/when I add gating, so refer to columns by name, not
position.}

\item{\code{peaks}}{matrix, containing the coordinates used for peaks when
calculcating initial parameter values.}

\item{\code{comps}}{a list of \code{\link{modelComponent}} objects included for
these data.}

\item{\code{model}}{the function (built from \code{comps}) to fit to these data.}

fitted model.}
