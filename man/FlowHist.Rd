\usage{
FlowHist(file, channel, bins = 256, window = 20, smooth = 20,
  pick = FALSE)

batchFlowHist(files, channel, bins = 256, verbose = TRUE, window = 20,
  smooth = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{character, the name of the file to load}

\item{channel}{character, the name of the data column to use}

\item{bins}{integer, the number of bins to use to aggregate events into
a histogram}

\item{window}{the width of the moving window used to identify local
maxima for peak detection via \code{caTools:runmax}}

\item{smooth}{the width of the moving window used to reduce noise in
the histogram via \code{caTools::runmean}}

\item{pick}{boolean; if TRUE, the user will be prompted to select peaks
to use for starting values. Otherwise (the default), starting values
will be detected automatically.}

\item{files}{character, a vector of file names to load}
}
\description{
Creates a \code{FlowHist} object from an FCS file, setting up the
histogram data for analysis.
}
\details{
Starting with a \code{flowFrame} object, read from a FCS file,
\code{FlowHist} will:

\enumerate{
\item Extract the intensity data from \code{channel}.

\item Remove the top bin, which contains off-scale readings we ignore
in the analysis.

\item aggregates the raw data into the desired number of bins, as
specified with the \code{bins} argument. The default is 256, but you may
also try 128 or 512. Any integer is technically acceptable, but I
wouldn't stray from the default without a good reason.

\item identify model components to include. All \code{FlowHist} objects
will have the single-cut debris model and the G1 peak for sample A, and
the broadened rectangle for the S-phase of sample A. Depending on the
data, additional components for the G2 peak and sample B (G1, G2,
s-phase) may also be added.

\item Build the NLS model. All the components are combined into a single
model.

\item Identify starting values for Gaussian (G1 and G2 peaks) model
components. For reasonably clean data, the built-in peak detection is
fine. You can evaluate this by plotting the \code{FlowHist} object with
the argument \code{init = TRUE}. If it doesn't look good, you can play
with the \code{window} and \code{smooth} arguments (which is tedious!),
or pick the peaks visually yourself with \code{pick = TRUE}.
