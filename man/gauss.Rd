Components for modeling Gaussian features in flow histograms

\details{
Typically the complete models will contain fA1 and fB1, which model the
G1 peaks of the sample and the standard. In many cases, they will also
contain fA2 and fB2, which model the G2 peaks. The G2 peaks are linked
to the G1 peaks, in that they require some of the parameters from the
G1 peaks as well (mean and standard deviation).

If the linearity parameter is set to "fixed", the G2 peaks will be fit
as exactly 2 times the mean of the G1 peaks. If linearity is set to
"variable", the ratio of the G2 peaks to the G1 peaks will be fit as a
model parameter with an initial value of 2, and constrained to the range
1.9 -- 2.1.

Additionally, for each set of peaks (sample and standard(s)), a
broadened rectangle component is included to model the S-phase. At
present, this is component has a single parameter, the height of the
rectangle. The standard deviation is fixed at 1. Allowing the SD to vary
in the model fitting doesn't make an appreciable difference in my tests
so far, so I've left it simple.
