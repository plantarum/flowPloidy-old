                  debris generation and compensation that can be applied to
                  paraffin-embedded frozen tissue preparations. The theory
                  predicts the distribution of fragments generated from
                  single and multiple random sectioning of threedimensional
                  ellipsoids representing nuclei. The fragment distribution
                  is assumed to be a major component of the underlying
                  debris in DNA histograms. A comparison of S-phase
                  fractions (SPF) from matched tissue prepared by frozen
                  and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded DNA methods
                  demonstrates the usefulness of the theory.},
